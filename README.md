## Description
sonos-web is a web interface for the Sonos Audio System,
created with the goal of having a nice looking interface to manage the queue, add streaming services like Spotify (even for non-premium users!) and allow other developers to customized the UX as they want by making the project expandable through plugins.

## Setup

### First things first
To use sonos-web you need:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v6.x+)
- Git
- A [Sonos Audio System](https://www.sonos.com/)
- An internet browser (Firefox is recommended)
- ffmpeg (in order to use the YouTube plugin)

### Instructions
1. Clone the repo  
`git clone https://github.com/denysvitali/sonos-web`
2. cd to the newly created folder (should be named `sonos-web`)  
`cd sonos-web/`
3. Install the dependencies  
`yarn install`
4. Compile the assets  
`npm run-script build`
5. Start the server  
`npm start`
6. See if it works, visit [http://localhost:8888/](http://localhost:8888/) or visit http://your-server-ip:8888/ from another location

Note: It may be required to `cd` into each plugins/ folder and do an `npm install` to make sure everything works.
YouTube requires ffmpeg to be installed on your system.
